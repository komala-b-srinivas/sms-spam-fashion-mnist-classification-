Project Title:
Model Evaluation and Tuning for Binary and Multiclass Classification Tasks

Project Description:
This project compares the performance of machine learning models on two different classification problems: spam detection using the SMS Spam Collection dataset and fashion item recognition using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Both tasks were implemented and evaluated using models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

We performed preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, training-validation learning curve plotting, and final evaluation using accuracy and macro-averaged F1 score. Learning and validation curves, as well as confusion matrices, were visualized and stored.

To Run:

1. Install required packages:
   scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, tensorflow

2. Download NLTK stopwords:
   python -m nltk.downloader stopwords

3. To run all models:
   python code/main.py

4. To generate individual learning curves:
   python code/learning_curve_sms_logreg.py
   (replace with desired model name)

5. To generate validation curves:
   python code/validation_curve_mlp_fashion.py.    # takes longer than 15 minutes to run
   python code/validation_curve_svm_sms.py

6. To generate TensorFlow training vs validation plot:
   python code/traning_vs_validation(sms).py

All outputs will be saved in the outputs/ folder.

Please note that all scripts related to the Fashion MNIST dataset (including training, tuning, and learning curves) take significantly longer to run compared to the SMS Spam dataset.
